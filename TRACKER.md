## 🔴 P0 — Most important

### 1. Per-user customisation (multi-tenancy)
**The big one.** Today the app stores ONE shared global trip (`TripConfig`),
shown to everyone regardless of login — which is why it says "41 days to trip"
even when signed out. _Not a bug; it's the current single-tenant design._

Plan:
- [~] **2a — Login-gated editing** (in progress):
  - [x] Server enforcement: middleware blocks all write APIs unless the admin
        is signed in (safe fallback keeps app editable if sign-in isn't set up).
  - [x] Admin = `ADMIN_EMAIL`; session exposes `isAdmin`; `useCanEdit()` hook.
  - [x] Global trip controls gated (destination switch, trip type, onboarding).
  - [ ] Hide remaining per-page add/edit buttons (expenses, journal, checklist,
        stays, etc.) for non-admins; friendly 401 toast.
  - [ ] **Requires in prod**: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` + `ADMIN_EMAIL` set in
        Vercel, else gating stays off (open editing).
- [ ] **2b — User-scoped data**: add `userId` to `TripConfig`, `Expense`,
      `JournalEntry`, checklist state, etc. Each signed-in user gets their own
      trip(s): own dates, budget, journal, checklist. Anonymous visitors see a
      read-only Ladakh demo (or a "sign in to start your trip" prompt).
- [ ] After 2b: the dashboard countdown/budget/journal all read the *current
      user's* trip instead of the global one.

## 🟠 P1 — Decisions needed

### 2. Landing page direction
- [ ] Three designs live at `/preview` (Editorial / Cinematic / Bento). Decide:
      pick one to wire up as the real landing, **or** keep opening directly to
      the Ladakh dashboard (current behaviour).

### 3. Header / logo polish
- [x] Left-aligned, responsive logo + top menus (Plan/Journal/Budget/More).
- [ ] Confirm sizing feels right; option to show top menus on phone too.

## 🟡 P2 — Enhancements / original roadmap

### 4. Speed
- [x] Stream home photos via Suspense + prayer-flag loaders.
- [ ] Optional: self-host key destination images to remove the Wikipedia
      round-trip entirely (faster cold loads).

### 5. Live data (from CLAUDE.md Phase 2)
- [ ] Skyscanner API for live Delhi–Leh flight pricing.
- [ ] Booking.com affiliate API for stay availability.
- [ ] Webhook endpoint for price-update triggers.
- [ ] Email notifications for availability/price changes.
